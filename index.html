  <h1 class="my-md-4">History</h1>
  <p>Microplastics are not a type of plastics, but rather are defined as any piece of plastic that is less than 5 millimeters, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Their existence is thanks to the widespread utilization of synthetic plastics. </p>

  <p>Plastics are synthetic or semi-synthetic organic compounds that have the property of plasticity, or are easily shaped or molded. Its use has been dated from as far back as 1600 BC in Mesopotamia, where naturally occurring plastics, like rubber, were used as a material. The first “synthetic” plastic was made in about the 1870s, after the invention of cellulose. Eventually, plastics evolved into the synthetic polymers we know today, like polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene, and polystyrene (PS).</p>

  <p>They are revered for their durability and versatility, low cost, and ease of manufacture, and of course, plasticity; they are commonly used as alternatives to other materials like wood, stone, leather, metal, and glass.</p> 

  <p>Now, it is almost impossible to imagine a world without using plastic; they are heavily integrated within our society. Our industries have revolved on the creation and use of plastics, and have been an important part of the economy for a while. Microplastics are a result from our excessive plastic use.
  </p>

  <h2>Current state of microplastic pollution</h2>

  <p>Not much is known about microplastics and their effects on the environment, but their prevalence and pollution is extremely concerning.</p>

  <p>Microplastics are found almost everywhere, in oceans, freshwater, soil, and even in the air. Most commonly, they are scattered among the huge expanse of ocean, and they have been accumulating for at least the past four decades. Their infinitesimal size allows marine creatures like sea turtles and fish to ingest them, leading the microplastics to integrate themselves into the food web. Microplastics can damage internal organs and leach hazardous chemicals ranging from BPA to pesticides, which can compromise the growth and reproduction of immune function. Because food chain base organisms like plankton are also being affected by such microplastics, the toxins from these microplastics can possibly spread devastatingly far and wide across the marine ecosystem.</p>

  <p>As we often eat fish or mollusks or other marine organisms for nutrition, we are on the receiving end of the microplastic pollution as well. By eating the polluted marine organisms, the toxins from these microplastics are accumulating in our own bodies as well, which can be carcinogenic or possibly containing pathogens and heavy metals. Materials in the plastics can also cause birth defects in males.</p>

  <p>We are constantly exposed to microplastics even without consuming food from the ocean. In 2018, microplastics were found in human feces for the first time, further cementing the prevalence of microplastics.</p>

  <h2>Current and future solutions</h2>

  <p>Trends are currently pointing towards increasing amounts microplastics in the environment, so solutions are actively being worked for this problem.</p>

  <p>One proposed solution is to use energy recovery for plastics, so instead of wasting and throwing away the plastic into landfills, it can be converted to energy. Because this doesn’t solve the problem of the overproduction of plastics, recycling is preferred. Programs to educate everyone on the importance of recycling can significantly reduce the amount of plastic circulating the environment. To rid of the plastics, biodegradation has been proposed. This involves having microorganisms break down such plastics to then be used as a form of energy and source of carbon.</p>

  <p>The US government is also increasing involvement: Illinois banned cosmetics with microplastics. Barack Obama passed the Microbead-Free Waters Act in 2015, which enacted a nationwide ban on “rinse-off” exfoliating cosmetic products. It took effect on July 1, 2017 for manufacturing and July 1, 2018 for distribution. The Save Our Seas Act, a legislation to abate marine pollution, has a section for microplastic reduction, which was passed on July 25th, 2018. The act is geared toward the NOAA’s Marine Debris Program.</p>

  <p>As microplastics are an alarming problem currently, it is in our best interests to find a way to rid of these tiny particles in our world.</p>
